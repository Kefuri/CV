## Haydon Houghton

Since my first computer science class in year 10, I knew writing code was something I'd love to be able to do for a career. One iteration loop later and the descent into the rabbit hole began.

Young and excited, I'm an 18 year old junior software developer raring to get into the world of software development and build
a career in the industry. 


## Skills
**Adaptation**
After moving countries twice and changing schools 3 times, being adaptable became second nature - and it was only pushed further in facilities. Whether it be adapting to the needs of workers when planning a warehouse refurbish or adjusting to a completely new culture, I'm more than capable.

**Problem Solving**
With a logical mindset built up from A-Level Maths and an intense internship in facilities, I can find efficient solutions to problems fast. Incredibly beneficial when your rubber duck won't tell you what the problem is.

## Experience

**Echo Pharmacy** (July '19 - November '19)    
*Facilities Assistant* 
- Communication with those in the workplace and delivering optimal solutions for people's needs
required logical and straight-to-the-point thinking. Missing deadlines meant operations could come to a halt, 
so I learnt to work with the pressure of many people depending on my actions.

**Freelance Software Development** (November '18 - May '19)     
*Junior Developer*
- Learning the ropes of asynchronous Python as a part-time developer for a Discord bot used in a 10,000+ user community. See my Kiara repo for my commit history. [Hyperlink Here]
I learned to take a brief and create a tool that was fitting to what the team needed and deliver it in a suitable timeframe.

**Work Experience - Software Development at Echo Pharmacy** (Summer '18)
- Experienced my first taste of real-world software development by shadowing devs and giving thoughts in weekly stand-ups.
Got to see how developers on a team work together to accomplish goals first-hand. Witnessed the deployment of a major tool for the Ops team and how the process was handled.

**Ryman Stationery** (August '17 - September '18 Part Time)     
*Sales Assistant*  
- Worked within a team to surpass sales goals, interacting with customers was the bulk of this job. 
Overall, the most important aspect of my role was building a good reputation for the brand with customers so 
that they'd want to come back again.


## Hobbies

Video Games - Nothing I love more than sitting down with a few friends and playing some fun, challenging games.

Photoshop - Pieceing together different graphic renders and playing with colour palletes was a fun way of channeling my creativity [Link DeviantArt once Set Up?]

Reading - Tucking into a novel is a great passtime. Especially if it's written by Haruki Murakami.
